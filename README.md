#  CNN model for Mnist classification
This solution is for the MNIST dataset classification problem. The dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits, along with their corresponding labels. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify these images.
## Acknowledgements
I would like to acknowledge the creators of Keras and TensorFlow for providing the tools to create this solution.
